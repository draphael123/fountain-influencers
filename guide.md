# <a id="_ym7tbpd1idz4"></a>__Fountain Creator Collaboration Guide__

## <a id="_elfo5c16m4sw"></a>__Goal of the Content__

Create honest, relatable short\-form videos that share a __real menopause or perimenopause experience__\.

This content should feel human and approachable — not overly polished, not overly salesy\.

While Fountain is a solution we want highlighted, the goal is for the content to feel like a __real person sharing something helpful__, not a scripted ad\.

__Content Format__

- __Video type:__ Short\-form video
- __Orientation:__ Vertical \(9:16\)
- __Length:__
	- Ideal: __1–2 minutes__
- __Recording style:__
	- __iPhone only__
	- Talking\-to\-camera
	- Clip\-on mic encouraged \(if available\)

Simple, clear, and natural is best\.

## <a id="_kc3j7ryz8dzi"></a>__Creative Direction & Planning Process__

To make sure we’re aligned *before* filming and avoid unnecessary edits or reshoots, we follow a light approval process\.

### <a id="_eorumfdm8tbd"></a>__Before Filming__

Creators are required to send:

- __3\-4 Content Ideas__
	- __Script not needed, just a basic description of the video concept__
- Include hook options for reach content idea

Hooks should clearly grab attention in the first few seconds and set up why someone should keep watching\.

We’ll review and give feedback on:

- Hooks
- Overall concept direction

Once approved, you’re good to film\.

## <a id="_ck0xq1e9biof"></a>__What We Want to See__

Creators can choose what feels natural to them, but content should:

- Have a __clear beginning, middle, and end__
- Be easy to follow
- Feel intentional

Example content themes:

- Why you started thinking about menopause or perimenopause support
- “Why most HRT clinics don't offer testosterone but Fountain does”
- Your experience navigating symptoms or changes
- How you think about menopause today vs before
- Day\-in\-the\-life or routine\-style reflections
- “Things I wish I knew earlier”
- Top tips or lessons *based on your experience*
- Your experience with hormone replacement therapy, or lack thereof
- Natural methods you’ve tried and what didn’t work for you

You can also get inspiration from our [__content ideas document__](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G8LK-ZYsz2fkMcnQvXDiRy-xluEO3msqd9oP4mhazls/edit?usp=sharing)\.

__Tone & Style__

- Conversational
- Honest
- Natural delivery
- Light structure is okay
- Speak primarily from __your own experience__

It’s okay to:

- Share personal tips
- Talk about what’s helped you
- Frame things as *“what worked for me”*

Please avoid:

- Broad or absolute statements \(e\.g\., “every woman will experience this at age 40”\)
- Framing advice as medical guidance

## <a id="_nuzr4ai9tys0"></a>__What This Content Is Not__

To stay compliant and avoid confusion, please do not include:

- Medical advice or diagnoses
- Weight\-loss promises
- Speaking as a medical expert

Personal perspective is great\. Medical claims are not\.

## <a id="_e8ks33upknrq"></a>__About Fountain & What We Offer__

To help you speak confidently about Fountain, here's what you need to know:

### <a id="_5h00nwiz2y9c"></a>__The Hormones We Offer__

- __Testosterone__ — topical cream \(uno dose applicator to inner wrist or knee\)\. 99% of our patients are on testosterone because it's essential for sex drive, motivation, bone health, and muscle retention\. Most HRT clinics don't offer it because it's a controlled substance that requires providers, which doesn't fit their business model\. We built our business specifically to offer it\.
- __Estrogen \(Estradiol\)__ — topical cream \(uno dose applicator\)
- __Progesterone__ — oral capsule \(provides endometrial protection\)
- __Vaginal Estrogen__ — cream

### <a id="_ho9m213ur53"></a>__Perimenopause vs Menopause__

- Perimenopausal women receive progesterone and testosterone \(they're still producing estrogen, so adding more would be unsafe\)
- For women on the cusp, we offer labs to determine if estrogen is appropriate
- Menopausal women typically receive all three hormones

### <a id="_9c453foz79wa"></a>__How Fountain's Process Works__

__Sign\-Up:__ Quick, mobile\-friendly online evaluation \(takes less than a minute\)

__Initial Treatment:__ Patients receive a customizable kit with uno dose dispensers \(testosterone and estrogen creams\) plus progesterone pills—not a pre\-mixed compound

__Biweekly Optimization:__ Every two weeks, patients complete a check\-in form\. Our medical team reviews it and a provider reaches out with personalized adjustments—titrating each hormone up or down to prevent side effects and find the optimal balance

__The 12\-Week Promise:__ Within 12 weeks, every patient reaches their ideal dose and receives a custom cream formulation with their perfect dosage—one pill and one click per day

### <a id="_m0ysvdpsi0pb"></a>__Why Fountain Is Different__

- Custom\-tailored dosing for every patient \(not one\-size\-fits\-all\)
- 12 weeks to your optimized hormone treatment \- Ends with one uno dose & 1 pill\.
- Biweekly medical oversight and adjustments during the 12 weeks \+ continued care after
- Virtually eliminates menopause symptoms: hot flashes, libido loss, poor sleep
- Significantly reduces osteoporosis risk vs untreated women
- Better muscle retention, joint health, and longevity

## <a id="_p7t01mbincvf"></a>__Brand Mentions & Required Talking Points__

While we want this to feel natural, the following points __must be covered__ somewhere in the content:

1. __Promote Your Custom Discount Link__
	- You'll receive a __custom discount link__ \(e\.g\.,[ www\.fountain\.net/name](http://www.fountain.net/paula)\)

	- The appointment with a provider who actually cares
	- A custom HRT treatment plan built for you
	- Treatment may include progesterone, testosterone, and estrogen
3. __Example Script__ \(adapt to your vibe\)

  
*"With my discount link, it's $32 for an evaluation with a provider who actually listens to you and builds out a HRT treatment plan that may include a variety of hormones such as progesterone, testosterone, and estrogen\."  
*

1. __Labs \(state\-dependent\)  
__*"For some states you may need to go in and get labs at LabCorp, and if so, Fountain helps set that up for you and covers the cost as part of your evaluation\."  
*
2. __Treatment Delivery  
__*"If you qualify for treatment, it gets delivered to your doorstep in days\."  
*
3. __Ease of Sign\-Up  
__Emphasize how simple the process is \(mobile\-friendly, online, takes only a couple of minutes\)  

4. __Share Your Experience  
__Describe the benefits you've felt since starting HRT with Fountain  

5. __Where You Are in the Fountain Journey  
  
__ Share your current stage, honestly:

If you’re not personally going through the Fountain process, you may speak generally about Fountain as a solution and why it exists\. We’ll guide you on appropriate phrasing\.

If it doesn’t sound like *you*, we’ll adjust it together\.

- Ask questions early
- Share ideas before filming
- Focus on being real, not perfect
